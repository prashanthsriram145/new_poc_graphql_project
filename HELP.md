1) Spring Boot can be configured to serve a user-friendly, in-browser tool called GraphiQL. It provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and documentation browsing.

To enable it, add the following property to your application.properties file:
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true

Once enabled, you can access the interface by navigating to the following URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/graphiql

2) Using Postman

Once your Spring Boot GraphQL server is up and running, you'll use a single URL endpoint to send all your GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions. This is a core concept of GraphQL, distinguishing it from a REST API's multiple endpoints.

1. The Default URL
   By default, the Spring for GraphQL library configures the main GraphQL endpoint at:

http://localhost:8080/graphql

If you're using a different port, just replace 8080 with your application's port number.

This URL accepts HTTP POST requests with a JSON body containing your GraphQL operation.

2. How to Test Your GraphQL API
   There are two primary ways to test your GraphQL API: using a graphical interface or a tool like Postman.

A. Using the Built-in GraphiQL Interface
Spring Boot can be configured to serve a user-friendly, in-browser tool called GraphiQL. It provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and documentation browsing.

To enable it, add the following property to your application.properties file:
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true

Once enabled, you can access the interface by navigating to the following URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/graphiql

From there, you can write and execute your queries, mutations, and subscriptions directly and see the results.

B. Using Postman

Postman is a popular API client that has excellent support for GraphQL.

Create a new request in Postman.

Set the HTTP method to POST.

Enter your GraphQL endpoint URL: http://localhost:8080/graphql

In the Body tab, select the GraphQL option.

In the QUERY text area, write your GraphQL query or mutation.

If you have variables, you can define them in the GRAPHQL VARIABLES section below the query.

Click Send to execute the request and see the JSON response in the body.

3) Query and Mutation request samples:

Create
mutation {
createBook(title: "1984", authorName: "George Orwell") {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}

Read
query {
getAllBooks {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}

Update
mutation {
updateBook(id: 1, title: "Animal Farm") {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}

Delete
mutation {
deleteBook(id: 1)
}


Paginated query
query {
getBooks(limit: 2, offset: 0) {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}

Search by author
query {
searchBooks(author: "Orwell") {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}

Search by title
query {
searchBooks(titleContains: "19") {
id
title
author {
id
name
}
}
}
Great question üëç ‚Äî GraphQL is powerful, but it comes with technical challenges you should be aware of before adopting it in a real-world system.

Here are the main ones:

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Challenges of Using GraphQL
1. Over-fetching / Under-fetching flips to N+1 problem

REST often leads to over-fetching, but GraphQL can create the opposite: many small queries (N+1 problem).

Example: Querying books with authors ‚Üí backend may fetch authors one by one unless you implement DataLoader/batching.

2. Performance & Query Complexity

Clients can ask for deeply nested data (book ‚Üí author ‚Üí books ‚Üí author...) ‚Üí queries may blow up in cost.

Need query complexity analysis / depth limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

3. Caching is harder

REST APIs can use simple HTTP caching (GET /books/1 ‚Üí cacheable).

GraphQL queries are POST requests by default, and payloads differ ‚Üí standard HTTP caching doesn‚Äôt work out of the box.

Solutions: Apollo caching, persisted queries, or custom layer.

4. Schema evolution & versioning

REST can version (/v1/books).

GraphQL schema is meant to evolve without breaking clients ‚Üí requires deprecation strategy, strong schema governance.

5. Error handling is less clear

REST uses status codes (404, 500).

GraphQL always returns 200 OK with "errors": [...] in the payload ‚Üí requires custom error classification & handling.

6. Authorization & Security

Different clients may request different fields ‚Üí field-level authorization is tricky.

You must secure not just the query but also every field (e.g., some users should not see salary in Employee).

7. File uploads / real-time support

REST handles multipart/form-data uploads naturally.

GraphQL requires workarounds (e.g., Apollo‚Äôs upload spec, or separate REST endpoints).

Subscriptions (real-time) require WebSocket infrastructure, more complex than REST polling.

8. Tooling & Monitoring

REST debugging is easy with cURL/Postman.

GraphQL queries are often long, deeply nested, and executed over WebSockets ‚Üí monitoring and logging are harder.

Requires tools like Apollo Studio, GraphQL Inspector, or tracing middleware.

9. Learning Curve for Teams

Developers must learn schema design, resolvers, DataLoader, and understand GraphQL-specific problems.

More complex than just exposing REST endpoints.


‚úÖ In short: GraphQL shines in flexibility and client-driven data fetching, but comes with server-side performance, caching, security, and tooling challenges that teams must plan for.
